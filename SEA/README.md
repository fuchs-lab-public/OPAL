## Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes, with its application in healthcare powered by the digitization of clinical data. This has led to the development of AI-based systems for diagnosis and prognosis in pathology. The digitization of pathology slides results in massive images that are often divided into many small tiles for analysis. Currently, most computational pathology focuses on training a tile-level encoder or a slide-level aggregator. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is increasingly being used for large-scale pretraining of visual encoders with better performance than previous models. However, training models from an entire pathology slide end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. We propose a new method to learn both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution. This method, although more computationally expensive, shows promise for large-scale pre-training of pathology foundation models.
